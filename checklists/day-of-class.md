# Day of the class

On the day of the class, at least a few hours before the class is held:

* Change topic in #archlinux-classroom to indicate the class and that the channel will be logged.
* Announce in #archlinux, #archlinux-newbie, and #archlinux-women periodically, such as every hour. Ask an op to add an announcement to the channel topics.

Right before the class:

* Give the teacher op so they can ban/quiet unruly people.
* Remind the teacher to delimit the start and end of the class to help whoever makes the logs. Example marker, *`----- class start -----`*.

Right after the class is over:

* Change topic in #archlinux-classroom.
* Thank the teacher and attendees.

Then follow the after class checklist.
