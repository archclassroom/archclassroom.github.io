# After the class

* In the past-classes repository:
  * Save logs to classlogs/. Time stamps are in UTC. Do not save parts, joins, and quits to protect people's privacy. Namely the only IRC messages needed to be saved are PRIVMSG, NOTICE, MODE, and TOPIC.
  * Move the announcement file from upcoming/ to announcements/.
* On the ArchWiki, move the class from the table of upcoming classes to the previous classes table.
* Post links to logs to the various announcement venues (mailing list, forums, etc.).
