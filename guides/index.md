# Checklists and guides

For teachers and classroom volunteers. Mostly the latter.

* New class — what to do when someone offers to teach a class (hint: do not sacrifice them)
* New notes and materials — directions to help someone start a new set of class notes and materials
* [Announcing a class](announcing.md) — directions for announcing a class
* [Day of the class](day-of-class.html) — checklists on what to do the day of the class
* [After the class](after-class.html) — checklist for things to do once the class is over (not necessarily on the same day as the class)
* Canceling a class — what to do when a teacher cancels a class (hint: still do not sacrifice them)
