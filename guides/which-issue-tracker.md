# Where to open an issue?

Arch Classroom uses GitHub's issue trackers for proposals, ideas, tasks, and whatnot. GitHub issue trackers are bound to specific repositories. So there is no generic project issue tracker. Arch Classroom has many repositories. It can be ambiguous or confusing to decide which issue tracker to post an issue to. The aim of this document is to help with that.

Obviously if an issue concerns the contents of a repository, it should go on that repository's tracker.

*Do not ask support questions. That is what the [forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/) and [IRC](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IRC_channel) are for.*

* request for new classes, a repeat of a past class, or notes for a new class topic — [past-classes](https://github.com/archclassroom/past-classes/issues)
* staff additions, retirements, or changes in status — [archclassroom.github.io](https://github.com/archclassroom/archclassroom.github.io/issues)
* general project and administrative issues — [archclassroom.github.io](https://github.com/archclassroom/archclassroom.github.io/issues)
