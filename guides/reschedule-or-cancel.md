# Reschedule or cancel a class

Post followups to any announcement indicating the change. If the class is being rescheduled, remember to give the new date and time. Ideally there should be at least a week or two before the new date when posting the followup.

If rescheduling, change the date to the new one in the class's file found in the directory [upcoming](https://github.com/archclassroom/past-classes/tree/master/upcoming) of the [past-classes](https://github.com/archclassroom/past-classes) repository.

If canceling, remove the class's file and say in the commit message the class is canceled.
