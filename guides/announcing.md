# Announcing a class

Announce a few weeks before the class to give people time make room on their schedules. Two weeks to a month in advance are preferred.

Past classes have been announced at these venues:

* [arch-general mailing list](https://lists.archlinux.org/listinfo/arch-general)
* [Arch Linux Forums classroom thread](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=143671)
* [arch-women mailing list](https://lists.archlinux.org/listinfo/arch-women)
* [r/archlinux](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/)

When posting to an Arch Linux mailing list, include [Classroom] in the front of the subject.

The teacher(s) should have already created and filled out a document in the directory [upcoming](https://github.com/archclassroom/past-classes/tree/master/upcoming) of the [past-classes](https://github.com/archclassroom/past-classes) repository. Announcements are drafted using the contents of that file.

Here are some examples of past announcements.

* [Introduction to Scheme and Functional Programming](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1445591#p1445591)
* [Git for Gits](https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2016-July/041562.html)
* [The Beginner's Guide to Arch Linux package management](https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2017-May/043712.html)
